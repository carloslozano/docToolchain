= How to install docToolchain

Let's get started...

Assuming that you first create your solution architecture and then the code, you simply start by getting a copy of the current docToolchain repository.
The easiest way is to clone the repository without history and remove the `.git` folder:

.linux with git clone
[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/rdmueller/docToolchain.git <your project name>
rm -rdI .git
----

Another way is to download the zipped git repository and rename it:

.linux with download as zip
[source, bash]
----
wget https://github.com/rdmueller/docToolchain/archive/master.zip
unzip master.zip
mv docToolchain-master <your project name>
----


If you work (like me) on a windows environment, just download and unzip the https://github.com/rdmueller/docToolchain/archive/master.zip[repository].

//[source]
//----
//(New-ObjectÂ Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('https://github.com/rdmueller/docToolchain/archive/master.zip','master.zip')
//----

This should already be enough to start a first build:


.linux with gradle wrapper
[source, bash]
----
./gradlew
----

.linux with maven wrapper
[source, bash]
----
./mvnw
----

.windows with gradle wrapper
[source, bash]
----
./gradlew
----

.windows with maven wrapper
[source, bash]
----
./mvnw.bat
----

As a result, you will see the progress of your build together with some warnings which you can just ignore for the moment.

The first build generated some file within the `<project>/build` folder:

[source]
----
<project>:
    build:
        docs:
            html5:
                images:
                arc42-template-de.html
                arc42-template-end.html
            pdf:
                arc42-template-de.pdf
----

*Congratulations!* if you see the same folder structure, you just managed to render the standard arc42 template as html and pdf!
